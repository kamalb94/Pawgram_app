## 🌟 What is Pawgram?

The idea behind Pawgram is simple: make pet adoption, awareness, and bonding easier through a single platform. You can:

- Search and explore dog breeds with images
- Learn about breed characteristics
- Discover real-life stories of dogs and their bonds with humans
- Enjoy dark and light modes with a clean, responsive UI

This is just the beginning — we’re also working on:

- A social feed to share short videos, photos, and dog training tips  
- Chat features to connect with pet lovers, NGOs, and local dog adoption centers  
- A hub for verified dog care information and resources

## 🐶 A gentle reminder

> *Do you know?* Every day, thousands of stray dogs go without food or clean water. Even a small gesture — a bowl of water or some food — can mean the world to them. Let’s be kind to all animals. They deserve love too. 💙
